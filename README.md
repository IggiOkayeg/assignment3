# Decentralized Storage Web Application
## Overview
This project is a decentralized web application (dApp) that facilitates agreements between storage providers and consumers. Using smart contracts, the platform ensures transparent and fair payments based on the amount of storage used. The core functionality implemented: Smart Contracts for Data Storage and Payments: Manages agreements between storage providers and consumers, ensuring transparent and fair payments based on storage used.

## Usage
### A: Preparation - How to Run the dApp Locally
Before running the application, ensure the following dependencies and tools are installed:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
Web3.js
Truffle (for smart contract deployment)
Ganache (for local blockchain network)
MongoDB (for local data storage)
You can install necessary packages with: npm install

### B: Setup Steps
1. Install Dependencies:
Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed by running the following command in your project directory: npm install

2. Run Local MongoDB:
Start your local MongoDB instance by opening a new terminal and running: mongod

3. Run Ganache & Deploy Smart Contracts:
Open Ganache on your machine to set up a local blockchain environment. After opening Ganache, deploy your smart contracts with the following command in the contracts directory: truffle migrate --reset --network development - This will compile and deploy the smart contracts to the local blockchain (Ganache).

5. Copy Smart Contract Address: 
After deploying the smart contracts, copy the contract address generated by truffle migrate and update it in both the frontend and backend configuration files.

5. Run Backend: 
In a new terminal, navigate to the backend folder and start the backend server: node index.js

6. Run Frontend: 
In another terminal, navigate to the frontend folder and start the frontend application: npm start - The frontend should now be accessible in your web browser on localhost:3001.

### C: Interacting with the dApp
The dApp connects to the blockchain network via Web3.js to facilitate interactions with the smart contract.
Ensure you connect your browserâ€™s MetaMask wallet to Ganache's local network for the frontend to interact properly with the blockchain.
